After youâ€™ve fine-tuned a model, 
remember that your prompt has to end with the indicator string `?\nAgent:` for the model to 
start generating completions, rather than continuing with the prompt. 
Make sure to include `stop=[".\n"]` so that the generated texts ends at the expected place.
Once your model starts training, it'll approximately take 2.47 minutes to train a `curie` model, and less for `ada` and `babbage`.
Queue will approximately take half an hour per job ahead of you.
